## üìö Why This Project?

This documentation is part of a final-year cybersecurity internship focused on developing and applying a **cloud penetration testing methodology** on AWS and Azure. It aims to:

- Support skill development in cloud attack simulation and auditing
- Help others reproduce and learn from realistic cloud security scenarios
- Provide clear and organized documentation of all work during the internship
